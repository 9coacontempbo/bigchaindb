## New Features
 
One of the most noticeable new features of ROBFEOY Ver.2.0 is the addition of a world map, which allows the player to travel between different locations more easily and explore new areas. The world map also shows the current time and weather, which can affect some events and encounters. For example, some monsters may only appear at night or during certain seasons.
 
Another new feature is the ability to customize the appearance of the protagonist and some of the female characters. The player can change their hair color, eye color, skin tone, clothing, accessories, and even their bust size. This adds more variety and personalization to the game and allows the player to create their own ideal partner.
 
A third new feature is the introduction of a card system, which allows the player to collect cards from defeated enemies or obtained from quests or shops. The cards can be used to enhance the protagonist's stats, skills, or equipment, or to unlock new scenes or options in the game. The cards are divided into different rarities and types, such as monster cards, character cards, event cards, etc.
 
## New Characters
 
ROBFEOY Ver.2.0 also adds several new characters to the game, both allies and enemies. Some of them are:

- Arena: A powerful angel who serves as the leader of the Heaven's Force, a group of angels who oppose the turncoat angel Thanatos and his army of demons. She is strict and righteous, but also compassionate and loyal to her friends.
